# Intro 

Let's look at the trees and models we've built for the patescibacteria.

## Datasets

We have 4 datasets: r202, r207, r214, r220. For each, we have the GTDB tree estimated in FastTree, and then my tree estimated with a GTR20+C60 PMSF model in IQ-TREE.

The datasets have increasing numbers of taxa for patescibacteria:

* r202: 1601 taxa
* r207: 2485 taxa
* r214: 3374 taxa
* r220: 4581 taxa

## r202 tree comparison

Let's load the FastTree and the IQ-TREE tree for each dataset

```{r}
library(phangorn)
setwd("/Users/roblanfear/Documents/github/bacterial-phylo/phlya/patescibacteria_analysis")
r202_ft <- unroot(read.tree("r202/subtree.nwk"))
r202_iq <- read.tree("r202/06_PMSF_tree_ufboot.treefile")
```

A few simple comparisons
